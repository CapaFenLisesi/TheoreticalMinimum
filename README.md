# The Theoretical Minimum

This started out as my notes for _[The Theoretical Minimum: What You Need to Know to Start Doing Physics](https://www.amazon.com/Theoretical-Minimum-Start-Doing-Physics/dp/0465075681)_ by Leonard Susskind and George Hrabovsky, but I ~want to grow it into a set of tools to help anyone learn physics~ converted it into a showcase for my work as an semi-formal STEM undergrad student. Susskind and Hrabovsky interpreted 'Theoretical Minimum' as the prerequisites to learning physics, and I'm interpreting it as the my work as an amateur STEM major. ;-)

## Problems...
... and their solutions

These are problems that I worked on, usually from random books or website challenges.

* [Doing Math With Python:](./BOOK_DMWP) these are solutions to problems from the book _[Doing Math with Python: Use Programming to Explore Algebra, Statistics, Calculus, and More!](https://www.nostarch.com/doingmathwithpython)_, which aims to introduce the reader to the Python scientific computing stack.
* [Project Euler:](./SITE_PROEULER) solutions to some of the problems from [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net). I'm not going to make the solutions public, but if you're an employer, feel free to request a copy.
