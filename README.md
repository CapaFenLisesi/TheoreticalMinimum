# Theoretical Minimum - Solutions

### Introduction

These are my solutions to the exercises in [_The Theoretical Minimum: What You Need to Know to Start Doing Physics_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/046502811X), a book that--like the title implies--tries to teach rudimentary classical physics in a somewhat informal, hacker-esque manner. These are formatted in [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) (IPython) notebooks, and I urge you to try out the problems yourself before checking out my solutions.
