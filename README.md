# The Theoretical Minimum

This started out as my notes for _[The Theoretical Minimum: What You Need to Know to Start Doing Physics](https://www.amazon.com/Theoretical-Minimum-Start-Doing-Physics/dp/0465075681)_ by Leonard Susskind and George Hrabovsky, but I ~want to grow it into a set of tools to help anyone learn physics~ converted it into a showcase for my work as an semi-formal STEM undergrad student. Susskind and Hrabovsky interpreted 'Theoretical Minimum' as the prerequisites to learning physics, and I'm interpreting it as the my work as an professional/amateur STEM major. ;-)

## Problem Sets
* [Doing Math With Python:](./problems/Textbook - Doing Math With Python) these are solutions to problems from the book _[Doing Math with Python: Use Programming to Explore Algebra, Statistics, Calculus, and More!](https://www.nostarch.com/doingmathwithpython)_, which aims to introduce the reader to the Python scientific computing stack.
* [Project Euler:](./problems/Project Euler) solutions to some of the problems from [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net). I'm not going to make the solutions public, but if you're an employer, feel free to request a copy.

## Coursework

### edX
* [Data Science](./courses/Microsoft - Data Science) a ten course programme by Microsoft that teaches that field of applied statistics called data science.
