# The Theoretical Minimum

## Introduction

This started out as my notes for _[The Theoretical Minimum: What You Need to Know to Start Doing Physics](https://www.amazon.com/Theoretical-Minimum-Start-Doing-Physics/dp/0465075681)_ by Leonard Susskind and George Hrabovsky, but I ~want to grow it into a set of tools to help anyone learn physics~ converted it into a showcase for my work as an undergrad student.Susskind and Hrabovsky interpreted 'Theoretical Minimum' as the prerequisites to learning physics.
