# LAFFer Curves

I am taking an introductionary online course on linear algebra called [LAFF: Linear Algebra - Foundations to Frontiers](https://www.edx.org/course/linear-algebra-foundations-frontiers-utaustinx-ut-5-05x-0) on the edX platform. This sub-project within my [Theoretical Minimum](https://github.com/mathmare/TheoreticalMinimum) will serve the notes I took, as well as a simple Python linear algebra library that I cooked up while taking this course.
