# Navigating the System (Week 1)

## Basic Commands

* This course deals with both a __GUI (graphical user interface)__ and a __CLI (command line interface/interpreter)__
    * With Windows, we'll be dealing with both the GUI and CLI
    * and with Linux, we'll just be dealing with the CLI
    
* The CLI in Linux is called a __shell__, and the language that we'll use to interact with this shell is called __Bash__.
* The course content for this week is broken down into two sections:
    * __Basic Operating System Navigation__
        * Navigating from one directory to another
        * Getting file information
        * Removing files and directories
    * __File and Text Manipulation__
        * Searching through your directories
        * Find a specific file
        * Copying and pasting
        * Chaining commands

* Here is a link to Microsoft's website providing information to their CLI: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/powershell-scripting?view=powershell-5.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/powershell-scripting?view=powershell-5.1)
* Here is a link to GNU for a reference manual for Linux's CLI: [https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html)
