# Problems...

_... and their solutions._

These are problems that I worked on, usually from random books or website challenges.

* [Doing Math With Python:](./BOOK_DMWP) these are solutions to problems from the book _[Doing Math with Python: Use Programming to Explore Algebra, Statistics, Calculus, and More!](https://www.nostarch.com/doingmathwithpython)_, which aims to introduce the reader to the Python scientific computing stack.
* [Project Euler:](./SITE_PROEULER) solutions to some of the problems from [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net). I'm not going to make the solutions public, but if you're an employer, feel free to request a copy.
